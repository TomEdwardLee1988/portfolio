Project that went on sale. Spec was a desktop APP that used a memory game (flipping matching cards) to create pairs. I completed this using HTML, CSS and JS. Then the client wanted the webpages packaged and delivered as a desktop app.

I used electron to package and created a dist (and installer), which could be uploaded to marketplace. I also integrated a security certificate to increase buyer confidence.

I have only included web pages on this commit (entry point is menu.html), as file was too large to commit. I have had to remove images, due to licencing restrictions from illustrator on public repository.

Full desktop app available on request.
