This is a clone of the Disney Website, as it was in February 2022. I started this project to get a better handle on CSS, and not using a tutorial.
I found the real website quite poor, with many missed spaces, and poor design choices - some of which I tried to correct in my copy.
The hardest element I found to complete was the scale aspect of the pictures, as the img remains in it's container, and doesn't grow outside the confines.
I tried to better organise my CSS into utility elements, and sections, rather than the disorganistation I'd done before.

Improvements - I've yet to make the site responsive to mobile, and finish off the footer. There is no JS in this project, as it was purely for CSS learning.
