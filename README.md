# portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio - I'm an aspiring full stack developer (MERN). Please feel free to browse my portfolio that demonstrates understanding in HTML, CSS, JS, NODEJS, Electron packager/builder, NODEJS, MongoDB.
I also manage a wordpress based site (thesltscrapbook.com), and have previously introduced stripe API, and woocommerce (since taken down by owner), to that site.
