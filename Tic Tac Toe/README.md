A TIC TAC TOE/Naughts and crosses game, made with HMTL, CSS and JS. Main focus was JS/DOM manipulation and game logic. Tried multiple ways to ensure game worked, but could not escape large IF statement. Use of CSS Grid - to learn that technology. Game was rather challenging to make, as needed not only to detect a win - but prevent players from continuing the game once there was a winner, hence the NULL in the players array.

Pleased with organisation of the JS, and calling functions within functions.

Improvements I would/will make - Addition of reset button, score persistance/best of three/five. Further styling.
