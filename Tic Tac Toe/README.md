A TIC TAC TOE/Naughts and crosses game, made with HMTL, CSS and JS. Main focus was JS/DOM manipulation and game logic. Tried multiple ways to ensure game worked, but could not escape large IF statement. Use of CSS Grid - to learn that technology.

Improvements I would/will make - Addition of reset button, score persistance/best of three/five. Further styling.
