Followed online tutorial and connected API to backend, then created front end to create AI image generation. User can enter prompt, and then website sends off to API to create image. MERN stack.

First use of REACT, and refresher in MOGODB and express, NODE.js backend.

Difficult project, as some things had changed since instructor made video - API endpoint was different, and headers had to be set differently - which I had to complete with no prior experience/knowledge.

Currently, saving pictures to front page doesn't function as I havn't connected that functionality to DB as yet, but creating image route is functional.
